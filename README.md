# Arc-Dps-Mechanics-plugin-Auto-Update
auto updater for arcdps that also auto updates the mechanics plugin for the arcdps app for Guild Wars 2

UpdateAll.cmd updates arcdps, then checks for updates to the mechanics plugin and finally launches Guild Wars 2
UpdateArcMechanics.cmd only updates the mechanics plugin and then launches Guild Wars 2

Use whichever you perfer. You may need to edit the files and change the directory for guildwars if it is not in program files.

<b>INSTALLATION:</b>

Just place whichever program you want in your guildwars directory inside the bin64 folder.
Default Guild Wars 2 directory is C:/Program Files/Guild Wars 2/bin64

<b>USAGE:</b>

Instead of running guildwars, just launch this program and it will ensure everything is up to date before launching guildwars.
This program will not autorun if you try to launch guild wars normally. You need to launch it in place of the guild wars application.

If you do not have arc dps installed, UpdateAll.cmd will get it and the plugin for you.
