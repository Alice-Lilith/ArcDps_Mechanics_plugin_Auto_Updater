# Arc-Dps-Mechanics-plugin-Auto-Update
auto updater for arcdps that also auto updates the mechanics plugin for the arcdps app for Guild Wars 2

UpdateAll.cmd updates arcdps, then checks for updates to the mechanics plugin and finally launches Guild Wars 2
UpdateArcMechanics.cmd only updates the mechanics plugin and then launches Guild Wars 2

Use whichever you perfer. You may need to edit the files and change the directory for guildwars if it is not in program files.
